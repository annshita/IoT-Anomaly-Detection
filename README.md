# IoT Anomaly Detection
IoT Anomaly detection on 4 datasets using 4 basic ML algorithms.
2 datasets - IoT-23 (cleaned_data.csv) and NSL-KDD are provided. Edge-IIoT was too big. All datasets are taken from Kaggle.

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

### 1. **NSL-KDD**

* Standard dataset for network intrusion detection.
* Contains both normal and attack records.
* Binary classification

### 2. **IoT-23**

* Real-world IoT malware traffic traces.
* Multiclass classification.

### 3. **Edge-IIoT**

* Dataset for Industrial IoT systems.
* Used for binary classification

### 4. **Edge-IIoT (Multiclass)**

* Edge IIoT dataset used for multiclass classification with multiple attack categories.

## ðŸ”§ Preprocessing

* Cleaned missing values.
* Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.
* Standardized numerical features using Min-Max scaling.
* Split datasets into training and test sets (typically 80/20 split).

## ðŸ§ª Implemented Models

Four classical machine learning algorithms were applied on all datasets:

1. **Decision Tree Classifier** (Scikit-learn `DecisionTreeClassifier`)
2. **Naive Bayes Classifier** (Scikit-learn `GaussianNB` or `MultinomialNB` depending on dataset)
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** (Scikit-learn `SVC` with kernel tuning)
4. **Logistic Regression** (Scikit-learn `LogisticRegression`)

* Naive Bayes generally performed well for datasets with discrete categorical features.
* Decision Tree provided interpretable results but prone to overfitting.
* SVM often yielded good accuracy but was computationally expensive for large datasets.
* Logistic Regression performed consistently for well-separated feature spaces.
